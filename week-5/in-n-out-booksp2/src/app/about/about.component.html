    <h1 class="blue">Who was Mark Twain?</h1>
    <p>
      Mark Twain, pseudonym of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, (born November 30, 1835, Florida, Missouri,
      U.S.—died April 21, 1910, Redding, Connecticut), American humorist, journalist, lecturer, and
      novelist who acquired international fame for his travel narratives, especially The Innocents Abroad (1869),
      Roughing It (1872), and Life on the Mississippi (1883), and for his adventure stories of boyhood, especially
      The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885). A gifted raconteur, distinctive humorist,
      and irascible moralist, he transcended the apparent limitations of his origins to become a popular public figure
      and one of America’s best and most beloved writers.
